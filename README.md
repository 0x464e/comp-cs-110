# COMP.CS.110 Programming 2: Structures
This repository contains all assignments I did for my university's 2nd programming course. The course was done with C++, and it was my first time seriously using C++ apart from just sometimes dabbling with a few scripts whenever needed.

I'd say everything here is awfully uninteresting, apart from the assignments that were "projects". So essentially they were harder and required more work.  
I put the very first ([pairs](https://github.com/0x464e/pairs)) and very last ([pairs_gui](https://github.com/0x464e/pairs_gui)) projects to their own repositories, but the other two ([/07/tramway2](https://github.com/0x464e/comp-cs-110/tree/master/07/tramway2) and [/11/hospital](https://github.com/0x464e/comp-cs-110/tree/master/11/hospital)) are here along with a screenshot of their assignments.

>**Some commits and other information about the repository's history may appear odd, this is because the commits were originally made to my university's private GitLab from my university account & email. Private/sensitive information had to removed from the commits.**

## Building/Compiling
No special instructions really, everything up to the GUI assignments will compile like any regular C++ code.  
The GUI assignments are done in Qt, so they require Qt binaries for compilation.  
The instructions found in [pairs_gui](https://github.com/0x464e/pairs_gui)'s README will apply for these.
